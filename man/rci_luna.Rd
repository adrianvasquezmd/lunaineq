\description{
Computes the Relative Concentration Index to quantify socioeconomic-related inequalities in a health indicator.
The function operates in two modes: \strong{(Mode A)} using a numerator and denominator (\code{health_numerator} and \code{health_denominator}),
which is the preferred and most accurate method as it relies directly on event counts; and \strong{(Mode B)} using an aggregated health indicator
(\code{health_indicator}) and population weights (\code{population_weights}), which is used when disaggregated data are not available.
The RCI is estimated using either the Fuller method (area under a fitted symmetric Lorenz curve) or the Wagstaff & Kakwani method
(regression approach). Optionally, the function computes correction variants (Wagstaff adjustment and Erreygers correction) when the health indicator is bounded (e.g., a proportion)
. The function provides automatic interpretations in four languages: Spanish, English, French, and Portuguese.
}
\details{
\subsection{Estimation methods}{
The Relative Concentration Index (RCI) can be estimated using two methods:

\describe{
\item{\strong{Wagstaff & Kakwani (WK) method}}{
The method estimates the index from the observed distribution by smoothing the empirical concentration curve and fitting a linear regression to obtain the RCI. The discrete expression used to summarise concentration is

\deqn{\mathrm{RCI} \;=\; \frac{\sum_j p_j \cdot (2X_j - 1) \cdot y_j}{\mu}}

where \eqn{p_j} is the population share of subgroup \eqn{j}; \eqn{y_j} is the value of the health indicator in subgroup \eqn{j}; \eqn{X_j} is the relative rank of subgroup \eqn{j}, calculated as \eqn{X_j = \sum_{i=1}^{j} p_i - 0.5\,p_j}; and \eqn{\mu} denotes the global mean of the health indicator. The fitted regression provides the RCI estimate and its confidence interval.
}

\item{\strong{Fuller method}}{
The method fits a symmetric Lorenz-type curve to the cumulative distribution and derives the RCI as the relative area between the fitted curve and the line of equality. The curve used is

\deqn{y = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{e^{k - 1}} - 1 \right)} \left( e^{\frac{x}{k - x}} - 1 \right)}

where \eqn{x} denotes cumulative population share, \eqn{y} denotes cumulative health indicator share, and \eqn{k} is a shape parameter estimated by minimizing squared deviations between observed and fitted values.

The RCI corresponds to the area between this fitted curve and the line of equality.
}
}
}

\subsection{Correction methods}{
When requested, the function returns two corrected indices derived from the standard RCI: the Wagstaff adjustment and the Erreygers correction.
The Wagstaff adjustment is implemented here as \eqn{RCI_{Wagstaff} = RCI / (1 - \mu)}, where \eqn{\mu} denotes the global mean of the health indicator; this rescales the RCI to account for upper bounds imposed by the mean when the indicator is bounded. The Erreygers correction is implemented here as \eqn{RCI_{Erreygers} = RCI \times (4\mu)}, producing an absolute-scale index (in percentage points when \eqn{\mu} is a proportion) suitable for comparisons of bounded indicators. Users should consult the original references for methodological details.

\note{
Mode B is an approximation used when only aggregated indicators and population weights are available; variance estimates may be less precise than those from Mode A (numerator/denominator).
